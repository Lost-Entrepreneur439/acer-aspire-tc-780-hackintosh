# acer-aspire-tc-780-hackintosh-ventura
 A prebuilt OpenCore EFI for macOS Ventura on the Acer Aspire TC-780

**WARNING! Ethernet IS required for initial half of setup if you use an internet-based installer. You will need to install Heliport for Wi-Fi.

This is a macOS Ventura EFI for the Acer Aspire TC-780, with support for Intel Wi-Fi cards. 13.3.1a working, with OpenCore 0.9.1 and fully up to date kexts. Remember to keep your kexts and OpenCore up to date! I recommend OCAuxiliaryTools to keep your kexts and OpenCore up to date. Remember to change your SMBIOS data too.
